"""Binary trees.

A binary tree is a class which has an attribute named right, and an attribute
named left. Each right and left attribute is either empty or points to another
binary tree node. This is a recursive data structure.

To make it useful in practice, there is at least one more attribute, named for
example 'value' that stores a user value.

Note: this is not about a binary search tree, just a binary tree.

Please make 2 functions:

1. given a node in the binary tree returns the list of ancestor nodes, including
itself. Lowest first.

2. given two binary tree nodes, returns the lowest common ancestor.
